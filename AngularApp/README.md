# Artist Directory – AngularJS2 Entity Framework, Firebase Data Storage 

AngularJS 2 provides advanced features for building single-page applications: declarative templates, two-way data binding, Typescript support, and dependency injection. And instead of the controllers typical of MVC architecture, AngularJS 2 now offers components. It's a great update, suitable for mobile and web developers alike.
